# Odin Weather App Planning

## Steps

- Set up html js css
- API functions first (Visual Crossing API)
  - Take a location and return weather data for that location.
  - Console.log information
  - Promises or async / await or both.
- Functions to process JSON data and return only required data.
- Form allowing location search, fetch weather info (still console.log)
- Display data on webpage
- Toggle Fahrenheit / Celsius
- Add styling
  - Look of page changes based on data
  - Background color
  - Images describing weather
  - Can use Giphy API to show weather-related gifs
- Add a 'loading' component to display from time form submitted until information back from APi.
